class PriorCVAE(nn.Module):
    r"""PriorCVAE approximates a Gaussian Process.

    Once trained, the module's `decoder` can be used as a generative
    model to simulate a GP from the samples it was trained on.

    Args:
        encoder: A module used to encode GP realizations and
            their hyperparamters.
        decoder: A module used to decode random vectors and
            GP hyperparameters into GP samples.
        z_dim: The size of the hidden dimension.

    Returns:
        An instance of the PriorCVAE network.
        $\hat{\mathbf{f}}$, a recreation of the original $\mathbf{f}$,
        along with $\mu$ and $\log(\sigma^2)$, which are often used
        to calculate losses involving KL divergence.
