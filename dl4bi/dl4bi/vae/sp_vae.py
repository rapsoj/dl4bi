class SPVAE(nn.Module):
    r"""SPVAE approximates any stochastic process.

    SPVAE could be understood as an approximation of the
    Karhunen-Loeve Expansion of a centered stochastic process:

    $$f(s)=\sum_{j=1}^\infty\beta_j\phi_j(s)$$

    Where the encoder is $f_\text{enc}:(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{f})\to\beta$
    and the decoder is $f_\text{dec}:(\mathbf{s},\beta)\to\beta^\intercal\phi(\mathbf{s})$.

    Once trained, the module's `decoder` can be used as a generative
    model to simulate samples it was trained on.

    Args:
        encoder: A module used to encode GP realizations and
            their hyperparamters.
        decoder: A module used to decode random vectors and
            GP hyperparameters into GP samples.
        z_dim: The size of the hidden dimension.
        p_holdout: Probability of holding out a location from
            the encoding process. These locations are then
            inserted back in the decoding process to ensure
            the latent randomness generalizes to new locations.

    Returns:
        An instance of the `SPVAE` network.
